# Hey there 👋

I'm Vivek, a Mechatronics Master's student based in Germany.

I focus on automation, PLC programming, robotics, and system integration.  
Most of my work revolves around industrial control systems, sensor-actuator integration, and real hardware implementation.

This profile showcases selected academic and practical projects in:
- PLC-based automation systems  
- Robotics & motion control  
- Embedded systems  
- Computer vision  

Everything here reflects hands-on implementation — from wiring and commissioning to debugging and validation.
