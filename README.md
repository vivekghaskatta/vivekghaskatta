# Hey there 👋

I'm Vivek, a Mechatronics Master's student based in Germany.

I focus on industrial automation, PLC programming, robotics, and system integration.
Most of my work involves implementing control logic, integrating sensors and actuators, and commissioning technical systems.

Here are some projects I’ve worked on:
- PLC-based automation systems  
- Robotics & motion control  
- Embedded systems  
- Computer vision  

Everything here reflects hands-on implementation — from wiring and commissioning to debugging and validation.
